# Personal Portfolio - Chirpy Jekyll

Welcome to my personal portfolio site built using the **Chirpy Jekyll** theme! This repository hosts my portfolio where I showcase my work as a **Field Engineer** and **Developer**, along with various projects focused on aviation, IT infrastructure, and community-driven solutions.

## **Overview**

This website is built using the [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), a minimal and highly customizable theme optimized for fast performance. It serves as my personal platform to share projects, insights, and blogs related to my professional work.

The website features:
- **Project showcase**: Highlighting key projects like **Trusted Travel**, **Travel Regulations Tracker**, and **www.jouf.app**.
- **Blog section**: Covering aviation, travel technology, and airport operational efficiency.
- **Dynamic flight scheduling**: Tools and real-time information for airport staff and passengers.
