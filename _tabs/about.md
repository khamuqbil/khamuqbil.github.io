## About Me

I am a **SITA Field Engineer** based at **Al Jouf Airport**, where I play a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless operation of IT systems that are critical to the airport's daily functionality. My responsibilities cover a wide range of technical and project management tasks, including system installations, upgrades, troubleshooting, and continuous improvements to the infrastructure.

### Key Projects and Responsibilities:

- **Migration & Upgrades:** Led the comprehensive migration from Windows 7 to Windows 10, ensuring smooth transitions with minimal disruptions. This upgrade enhanced security, boosted performance, and future-proofed the airport’s IT infrastructure.

- **Workstation Deployment & Configuration:** Installed and configured new workstations for airport staff and operations, significantly improving system performance and reliability, contributing to more efficient daily operations.

- **Infrastructure Enhancements:** Managed the entire process of upgrading key network components, including server switches, routers, and connectivity systems. Oversaw the complete cabling process for both network and power points within a tight deadline, achieving a 20% improvement in data transfer speeds, increased network stability, and enhanced operational efficiency across the airport. Delivered these improvements with zero operational impact and a 98% success rate in the first deployment wave.

- **Airport Management System (AMS):** Led the installation and configuration of the **AMS** workstations and system infrastructure. Managed the cabling and setup for the system and ensured seamless integration with existing processes, optimizing airport management functions without affecting airport operations.

- **Flight Information Display System (FIDS):** Played a key role in installing and configuring the **FIDS**, managing the entire process from cabling to setup, and enhancing real-time flight information delivery to passengers, thereby improving the overall travel experience.

- **Proactive System Maintenance:** Monitored, troubleshot, and maintained IT systems to prevent downtime and ensure continuous operation of critical airport systems. This proactive approach ensured uninterrupted operations, contributing to higher operational efficiency.

- **Technical Support & Troubleshooting:** Provided both on-site and remote technical support for various IT systems, from passenger processing tools to backend infrastructure, ensuring immediate issue resolution and maintaining high service standards.


### Additional Projects

- **Aljouf Platform** As a personal project, I developed and launched **[www.jouf.app](https://jouf.app)**, a platform created freely for my community in Al Jouf. This project helps residents and airport staff stay updated on flight schedules and provides helpful information about travel and aviation. The success of this project has encouraged me to explore further opportunities in IT and community-based initiatives[read more](https://khamuqbil.github.io/travel%20technology/airport%20operations/efficiency%20tools/community%20projects/2023/12/23/aljouf-platform.html).

- **Trusted Travel:** Developed and managed a system during COVID to assist international passengers with the complex travel requirements of various countries. This system streamlined the process by organizing and preparing all necessary documentation for travelers, ensuring compliance with entry requirements. It helped both passengers and ground handlers by reducing travel complexities and ensuring that all necessary documents were completed and verified before boarding.

- **Travel Regulations Tracker:** Built during COVID to assist ground handlers by automating the process of tracking evolving travel regulations. The system pushes notifications and sends alerts as soon as new travel regulations are published, ensuring that ground staff stays up-to-date with the latest compliance requirements.


My role as a **Field Engineer** requires the ability to work in fast-paced, high-pressure environments, handling multiple projects simultaneously while maintaining a focus on modernizing and improving the airport’s IT infrastructure. I am committed to driving innovation and efficiency within the aviation industry and contributing to my local community through technology.
